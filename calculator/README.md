Modern Web Calculator - Web Development Task 3
A fully functional, responsive web-based calculator developed during my internship at @CodSoft. This project focuses on handling complex mathematical logic and providing a sleek, user-friendly interface.

🚀 Features
Basic Arithmetic: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Advanced Operations: Includes functionality for percentages, square roots, and sign toggling (+/-).

Keyboard Support: Users can perform calculations using both on-screen buttons and their physical keyboard.

Responsive UI: Optimized for all screen sizes, featuring a modern dark-themed aesthetic that matches my Galaxy Portfolio.

Error Handling: Built-in logic to prevent multiple decimal points and handle "Division by Zero" errors gracefully.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Structured for accessibility and clear button mapping.

CSS3: Custom properties and Flexbox used for the grid layout and hover effects.

Vanilla JavaScript: Core logic for parsing strings and executing mathematical operations without external libraries.
